                <h3 class="h3left4">Simple animation</h3>
                <p class="pleft5">We focused on building animations using CSS and HTML. We also got introduced to JavaScript, which we later on implemented in this assignment in order to be able to control our simple animations. The project was to create a webpage, where a character would be able to do simple movements. The webpage had to contain 10 toggle buttons that would allow the user to start and end an animation.</p>

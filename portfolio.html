                <p class="pleft2">The assignment was to code a scene from a movie or fairy-tale as well as prepare a storyboard and a sequence diagram for that storyboard. The key point of this project was to make our story interactive. We had the theme Surrealism and we decided to do Alice in Wonderland and show the hole scene.

                <h3 class="h3left4">Simple animation</h3>
                <p class="pleft5">We focused on building animations using CSS and HTML. We also got introduced to JavaScript, which we later on implemented in this assignment in order to be able to control our simple animations. The project was to create a webpage, where a character would be able to do simple movements. The webpage had to contain 10 toggle buttons that would allow the user to start and end an animation.</p>

                <p class="pright7">For this assignment we had to re-design an already existing website in order to make it more user-friendly. We got a website about Irish wrecks that are suitable for diving. Since it was a group work, we first analysed our skills within the team and prepared a working plan.</p>
